this folder just stores the code samples we use for the Hero component.

We edit them separately and then run the shiki syntax highlighter on it.

nothing else in this repo relies on this folder.

to use:

- run index.js and generate the html (or `npm run samples` from root)
- inspect `codesamples/HeroSamples.js` and copy into `component/HeroSamples.js`

tip: we use the palenight code theme but we want the comments in green - #90EE90 - so that it shows up nicer
